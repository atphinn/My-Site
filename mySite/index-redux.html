				Alexander Phinn is a freelance web developer and graphic designer that was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. He studied fine and graphic art at the Laguardia High School of the Performing Arts and the Pratt Institute. His regular travels throughout Europe and Japan and this intensive arts education have coalesced into a style that draws influence from contemporary and ancient art from all over the world. New York Cityâ€™s own dynamic style has also been a continuous force driving his work, and this is visible in both his aesthetic and professional approach. Additionally, his experience in the digital advertising industry has given him a broad and practical professional base with a focus on communication and problem-solving.
