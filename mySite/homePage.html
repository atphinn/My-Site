				An freelance web developer and graphic designer born and raised in Brooklyn, I have enjoyed unique access to contemporary and ancient art from all over the world, and regular travel throughout Europe and Japan along side my broad professional base with a focus on communication and problem-solving, coupled with this intensive graphic arts education, has given me a rich grounding in a variety of interconnected fields. New York Cityâ€™s own dynamic style has been a continuous force driving my work, and this is visible both in my aesthetic and professional approach.
